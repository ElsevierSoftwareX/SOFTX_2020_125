# This is just a collection of notes on how to create dqsegdb documentation from the Git repository.
# Started by Robert Bruntz on 2020.03.09

Steps:
* In a clone/branch of the dqsegdb repository:
   * (maybe create a new virtual environment: - be careful with this section; might be incomplete or unclear)
      * python3 -m venv /root/venv_dqsegdb_2020.03.09a
      * source /root/venv_dqsegdb_2020.03.09a/bin/activate
      * cd /root/venv_dqsegdb_2020.03.09a/
      * git clone https://github.com/ligovirgo/dqsegdb.git
   * A) install dqsegdb from the downloaded version
      * cd dqsegdb
      * python -m pip install .
   * B) install dqsegdb from the PyPI version
      * python -m pip install dqsegdb
   * probably also need to install lalsuite to get 'lal' (e.g., 'python -m pip install lalsuite')
* Check on issues with old versions of dqsegdb (<= 1.6.1):
   * dqsegdb/doc/conf.py: Make sure "sphinx.ext.pngmath" has been changed to "sphinx.ext.imgmath"
   * dqsegdb/doc/dqsegdb.rst: Make sure that the line ".. automodule:: dqsegdb.version" has been changed to ".. automodule:: dqsegdb._version"
   * dqsegdb/apicalls.py: In the docstring for "def dqsegdbFindEndTime(flag_dict):", make sure that the line after "Parameters" has been changed from underscores to dashes and that there are the same number of dashes as the number of characters in "Parameters" (10)
* Navigate to dqsegdb/doc/
* dqsegdb/doc/conf.py: Set the version of documentation to match the version of dqsegdb in the "version = " and "release = " lines (probably set to the same value for both, e.g., "version = 1.6.1"
* Run 'make html'
   * If everything works properly, documentation should show up in dqsegdb/doc/_build/html/; the contents of that dir can be copied to a web-accessible dir and accessed as-is, as long as files have permissions xx5 (e.g., 755)
   * Here are some possible issues and fixes:
      * (make blank dqsegdb/doc/_static dir to get rid of the "WARNING: html_static_path entry '_static' does not exist" warning - but are there any risks or side effects? investigate and document here)
      * If you get "make: sphinx-build: Command not found" - install 'sphinx' (e.g., 'python -m pip install sphinx')
      * If you get "Extension error:  Could not import extension sphinxcontrib.programoutput (exception: No module named 'sphinxcontrib.programoutput')" - install 'sphinxcontrib-programoutput' (e.g., 'python -m pip install sphinxcontrib-programoutput')
      * If you get "Extension error:  Could not import extension numpydoc (exception: No module named 'numpydoc')" - install 'numpydoc' (e.g., 'python -m pip install numpydoc')
      * If you get a warning like "WARNING: Unexpected return code 1 from command 'ligolw_segment_query_dqsegdb --help' " - not sure what's going on there; if you figure it out, update this document (but the time it showed up, 'ligolw_segment_query_dqsegdb --help' *did work*, so it doesn't seem to be an actual problem)
      * If you host the page on GitHub Pages, but it looks very plain (white background, black regular text, blue hyperlinks), whereas the same page hosted on a CIT machine has nice formatting, colors, etc., and the search.html page has the message "Please activate JavaScript to enable the search functionality." on it, it's probably b/c GitHub by default expects the site to be generated by Jekyll, which (using these instructions) it wasn't.  Try adding an empty file named ".nojekyll" to the dir that contains index.html; that got JS working for us on the one occasion that this came up.
